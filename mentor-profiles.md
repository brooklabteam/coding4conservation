**Sophia Horigan** is a PhD Candidate in Dr. Cara Brook’s lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. She received her B.A. in Biology from Lewis & Clark College in 2016, and her M.Sc. from the University of Chicago in 2021, where she was advised by Dr. Greg Dwyer. Before entering graduate school, she worked as a lab technician at Lewis & Clark College, a teaching assistant for a study abroad trip to Australia, and a science educator in the Tech Museum in San Jose, California. Sophia is a field and computational ecologist who combines data and models to understand and predict disease dynamics, with a particular interest in asking questions at the intersection of public health, environmental health, and animal conservation. For her Master’s thesis, she examined the role of spatial mechanisms in the population dynamics of an invasive lepidopteran infected by multiple pathogens. In the Brook lab, she will be using models to inform a strategic vaccination campaign against henipaviruses in bats with the goal of reducing the potential for zoonotic spillover.

She received her B.A. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University in 2010, and her Ph.D. in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology from Colorado State University in 2019, where she was advised by Dr. Joel Berger. She held a postdoctoral position at Colorado State University under the supervision of Dr. Kathryn Stoner before joining the Brook lab in 2021. Theresa’s a field ecologist and conservation biologist who has studied species as diverse as crocodilians, beach-nesting birds, mountain gorillas, and African elephants. For the last nine years, she has largely focused on the population and community ecology of bat communities in the deserts of northwestern Namibia and the southwestern United States, and currently in forest ecosystems in Madagascar as a member of the Brook lab.

<img src="/assets/mentors/miarinjara,adelaide.jpg" class="rounded float-start img-profile" />

**[Adelaide Miarinjara](https://adelaidemiarinjara.com/)** scientific career is dedicated to studying the entomological aspect of plague disease, and her research interests are focusing on understating the ecological and environmental factors modulating the ability of flea species to transmit the plague bacterium. Currently she is a postdoc at Gillespie’s lab at Emory University. Before that she held a first postdoctoral position at the Plague Section of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Hinnebusch, she studied the mechanisms of flea-borne transmission of Yersinia pestis, the plague bacterium.She received a Ph.D. degree in Medical Entomology in 2017 from the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar. She was part of the Medical Entomology Unit of the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, where she conducted various research on plague disease such as flea taxonomy, phylogeny, vector control, and insecticide resistance. She started as a master’s student intern in 2012, as a Ph.D. student in 2014, and now as a  research collaborator.

**[Veronarindra Ramananjato](https://www.razafindratsima.org/lab-members.html)**, Vero for short, is a PhD candidate in Dr. Razafindratsima’s lab. She has a MS in Animal Conservation Biology from the University of Antananarivo (Madagascar) and is currently working on her PhD project at the University of California Berkeley. Her project aims to provide insights on the seed dispersal effectiveness of nocturnal and omnivorous species and use such knowledge to inform solutions for their conservation in a changing world. She addressed this by focusing on mouse lemurs in Madagascar’s rainforests and the effects of habitat fragmentation on their seed dispersal services. Vero has also interests in plant-animal interactions and their eventual applications for biodiversity conservation.

**[Onja Razafindratsima](https://www.razafindratsima.org/)** is an Assistant Professor in Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. A Malagasy ecologist and a National Geographic Explorer, Onja is passionate about tropical ecology and conservation with a strong focus on plant-animal interactions, lemur ecology and seed dispersal. Onja earned a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Rice University and was later a Hrdy Fellow in Conservation Biology at Harvard University.
