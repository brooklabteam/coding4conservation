	<img src="/assets/mentors/klinges,david.JPG" class="rounded float-start img-profile" />
	<strong>Dave Klinges</strong> is a third year PhD Candidate at the University of Florida. He is interested in understanding where, when, and why is climate change or land use change a greater threat to biodiversity and natural resources, and uses a combination of geospatial tools, high-powered computing, and on-the-ground data collection to map and model from local to global scales. His research program currently centers upon two primary projects: using mechanistic microclimate modeling to understand spatiotemporal drivers of microclimate globally, and exploring how human modification of forested landscapes in Madagascar shapes near-surface temperature as well as amphibian diversity and distributions. Through this work he intends to expand fundamental knowledge of ecoclimatic relationships, while integrating academic insights into real-world conservation.

	<strong><a href="https://www.razafindratsima.org/lab-members.html">Veronarindra Ramananjato</a></strong>, Vero for short, is a PhD candidate in Dr. Razafindratsima’s lab. She has a MS in Animal Conservation Biology from the University of Antananarivo (Madagascar) and is currently working on her PhD project at the University of California Berkeley. Her project aims to provide insights on the seed dispersal effectiveness of nocturnal and omnivorous species and use such knowledge to inform solutions for their conservation in a changing world. She addressed this by focusing on mouse lemurs in Madagascar’s rainforests and the effects of habitat fragmentation on their seed dispersal services. Vero has also interests in plant-animal interactions and their eventual applications for biodiversity conservation.
