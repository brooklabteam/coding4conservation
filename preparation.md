### **Software installations**

We ask that you please begin to familiarize yourself with the computer programs that will be used throughout the duration of the training. You will need a personal computer with internet access in order to participate, though funds are available to support the purchase of data credit to facilitate your participation. If you do not have access to a computer, please email Cara Brook at [cbrook@uchicago.edu](cbrook@uchicago.edu) immediately to find a solution.

Once you have selected a computer for use for the workshop, please be sure that the following programs are installed and working:

* Excel, or a compatible spreadsheet software such as [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/)
* R – a statistical programming language ([Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/), and [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/))
* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) – a user interface for R that will be needed for computer exercises

If you have any problems loading and/or the software, please let us know immediately. We expect you to be familiar with all material presented in these tutorials prior to the first meeting on June 13.

### **Preparatory assignment**

In addition to the above tutorials, we ask that you prepare one powerpoint slide (saved in PDF format) summarizing your research prior to your arrival to C4C. Please be prepared to present your slide to the rest of the class in a short, 2-minute oral presentation on zoom on Monday, June 13.

On this slide, please summarize (a) your overall research question, (b) the dataset you presented in your application abstract, (c) your plan for analysis, and (d) the areas in which you are most eager to receive help and feedback in the upcoming year. 

We recommend including 1-2 visual aids (e.g. figures or diagrams) that will help you explain key aspects of the research. Please keep the text on your slide to a minimum. Do not attempt to explain all of the details of your project – stick to the essentials and keep it simple. You will be kept to time.

To speed up progress on the presentation day, we will collect slides in advance and share from a common computer, while you present. 
**<span style="color:red"> We ask that you please submit the PDF version of your slide [here](https://airtable.com/shrB0M73fZ2HfqBdu) by midnight on Friday, June 10 in advance of arrival to the workshop.</span>**

 Please use the following naming convention upon submission: "C4C_2022_Prep_Slide_LastName_FirstName.pdf"
