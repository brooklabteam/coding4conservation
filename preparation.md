### **Software installations**

We ask that you please begin to familiarize yourself with the computer programs that will be used throughout the duration of the training. You will need a personal computer with internet access in order to participate, though funds are available to support the purchase of data credit to facilitate your participation. If you do not have access to a computer, please email Cara Brook at [cbrook@uchicago.edu](cbrook@uchicago.edu) immediately to find a solution.

Once you have selected a computer for use for the workshop, please be sure that the following programs are installed and working:

* Excel, or a compatible spreadsheet software such as [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/)
* R – a statistical programming language ([Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/), and [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/))
* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) – a user interface for R that will be needed for computer exercises

### **Preparatory tutorials**

After you have installed R and R studio on your computer, **<span style="color:red">please begin to work through the [four tutorials](tutorials/R_tutorials.zip) linked here.</span>** All of them are extensively annotated with directions. If you have any problems loading and/or the software, please let us know immediately. We expect you to be familiar with all material presented in these tutorials prior to the first meeting on June 13.

If you are struggling with the installation and/or introductory tutorials, you can find additional instruction at [this helpful website](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_intro.asp). Please review the material as needed. We will have an open day for

### **Preparatory assignment**

In addition to the above tutorials, we ask that you prepare one powerpoint slide (saved in PDF format) summarizing your research prior to your arrival to C4C. Please be prepared to present your slide to the rest of the class in a short, 2-minute oral presentation on zoom on Monday, June 13.

On this slide, please summarize (a) your overall research question, (b) the dataset you presented in your application abstract, (c) your plan for analysis, and (d) the areas in which you are most eager to receive help and feedback in the upcoming year. 

We recommend including 1-2 visual aids (e.g. figures or diagrams) that will help you explain key aspects of the research. Please keep the text on your slide to a minimum. Do not attempt to explain all of the details of your project – stick to the essentials and keep it simple. You will be kept to time.

To speed up progress on the presentation day, we will collect slides in advance and share from a common computer, while you present. 
**<span style="color:red"> We ask that you please submit the PDF version of your slide [here](https://airtable.com/shrB0M73fZ2HfqBdu) by midnight on Friday, June 10 in advance of arrival to the workshop.</span>**

 Please use the following naming convention upon submission: "C4C_2022_Prep_Slide_LastName_FirstName.pdf"

### **Food, accommodation, and weather**

All meals and lodging during the workshop will be provided, beginning with lunch on Monday, January 6 (please eat breakfast prior to arrival) and ending with lunch on Sunday, January 12 (you will be responsible for your own dinner the evening after return to Tana). With the exception of lunch during both transit journeys, all meals will take place at Centre ValBio. Additionally, lunch, snacks, and coffee will be provided at our mandatory closing session at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM) on Tuesday, January 14, as well as at the optional 'R bootcamp' which will precede the workshop at IPM on Saturday, January 4 and Sunday, January 5.

Our workshop takes place at the onset of the rainy season in Madagascar’s summer. As such, it will be hot and humid in Ranomafana, so please pack accordingly. While most of our workshop will take place in the CVB conference room, some of our sessions will involve hiking outside. Please bring bug-repellent clothing (long sleeves and pants), hiking shoes, and rain gear. Each participant should also bring a backpack, a water bottle, and a headlamp or flashlight to take on the trail.
